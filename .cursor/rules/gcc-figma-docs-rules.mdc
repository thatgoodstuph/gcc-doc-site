# Context
We are building a GCC design system documentation site, inspired by the structure of Primer’s docs (Foundations → Components → Patterns → Meta). 

The site must:
- Mirror the GCC component and pattern list currently documented in Figma.
- Provide consistent, Material/Primer-style documentation for each component and pattern.

# Information Architecture
The site must use a persistent sidebar with the following top-level sections:

## 1. Foundations
- Color
  - Color
- Typography
  - Typography: GT Walsheim
  - Typography: Noto Sans Japan
- Effects
  - Effects (shadows, blurs, overlays)
- Spacing
  - Spacing
- Grid
  - Grid System
- Icons
  - Icon
- Illustrations
  - Illustration
- Logo
  - Logo
- System Resources
  - System Resource

## 2. Components (Alphabetical)
- Accordion, Audio Player, Badge / ABO Pin Level Badge, Breadcrumb, Button, Carousel, Checkbox, Context Menu / Ellipsis, Country Flags, Date Picker / Calendar, Drawer, Dropdowns, Error / Information Cards, Header Web, Highlights, Inline Messages, Input Fields, Loaders, Modal, Notification, Pagination, Pills / Chips, Progress Tracker / Slider / Stepper, Quantity Selector, Radio Buttons, Section Divider, Slide Over, Tabs, Tags, Text Area, Toggle, Tooltip, Variant Selector.

## 3. Patterns
- Article, Cart, Checkout, Coupons & Promo Cards, Data Visualization, Education Cards, Footer, Ingredient Card, List, Mobile Phone Verification, Product Cards, PDP Product Details, Ratings & Reviews, Rich Text Editor, Search, Share Bar, SOP Components, Sort / Filter, Table, User Name / Password / Password Strength.

## 4. Product / Market
- ABO Business Tools
- Account Management Components
- AI Components
- Amway+
- "JTX 定性調査 UJ 1-3"
- Wellbeing+

## 5. Meta
- About GCC Design System
- How to Use These Docs
- Changelog
- Contribution & Governance

# Page Templates (Primer-style)

## Foundations pages
Each Foundations page must include: Overview, Tokens / Scales (tables/galleries), Usage (Dos/Don'ts), Examples, and Accessibility considerations.

## Component / Pattern pages
Every page under Components, Patterns, and Product / Market must follow this structure:
1. **Overview**: 2–4 sentences on problem/solution.
2. **Usage**: When to use/not use, Dos & Don’ts, Content guidance.
3. **Anatomy**: Labeled breakdown mapping to code API/props.
4. **Behavior & States**: Interaction, keyboard behavior, and responsive notes.
5. **Variants**: Supported visual/behavioral variations.
6. **Accessibility**: Semantic elements, ARIA roles, and keyboard requirements.
7. **Tokens & Theming**: Key design tokens (no hard-coded hex/spacing).
8. **Code & API**: Canonical code examples and Props table.
9. **Examples**: Real GCC product scenarios and compositions.

# General Rules
- **Naming**: Drop the literal "GCC Component" suffix from UI titles.
- **Style**: Concise, directive, and scannable (headings + bullets).
- **Source of Truth**: If Figma and code disagree, call out the discrepancy but prefer the implemented code behavior.
- **URLs**: 
  - `/foundations/typography/gt-walsheim`
  - `/foundations/typography/noto-sans-japan`
  - `/components/[name]`
  - `/patterns/[name]`
  - `/product/[name]`
